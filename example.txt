l registered successfully!Yan! Heyyy there. You only installed it because of me? ☺️👉🏻👈🏻

I will wait for your letter and then will answer you ^^YesAnd oh your profile picture...wow..amazing...you are an elf?😯😍It’s my personal photoIt's pretty nice ^^ I have to go shopping now. I will write you later, when your letter arrived me :)Ok拜拜A piece of music that I like so much suddenly flashed a lot of memories in my mind, which made me a little sad. I recorded it. This music is suitable for you to lie in bed and enjoy it quietly.I was just jogging...I'm so exhausted now 😯 I just will take a shower, eat something and later bake a cake ^^

And I saw that the letter still needs some hours 😅It’s okay,wait slowlyThis music be listened to before going to bed,feeling differentI’m going to bed, good nightGood night Yan!I'm sorry, my English is not very good and I'm still working hard to learn... I originally wanted to reply to the English you said to me yesterday, but I need to listen multiple times to understand. Due to my slow input of English, I didn't reply to you last night. Do you like that music? I hope the things I share can meet your taste. The name of this music is Christmas Snow. It was a song I listened to in high school. I am a sensitive person and hearing this song will bring me different emotions. How long will you run? Although it may be tiring after running, your body will feel comfortable and full of strength after exercise. (ง •̀_•́)งWe have a time difference, and now you are still in your sleep. When Tobia wakes up, I hope Tobia can have a fulfilling, happy, and smooth day!Aww thank you ☺️

I also hope you have good day!Don't worry about your english. Just try it and you can always ask me if you don't understand something :)

And yes I said that the song is really beatiful and that I really like it.
And I can imagine that it triggers many emotions in you.

I also know such songs, which can trigger many emotions 😊

And I think it's truly a wonderful thing that you are so sensitive 😍
That's a very valuable property!And I ran 40 minutes...which was a little bit to long...I should ran the half of it 😅
But it's alright and it was kinda funny.

You know I love being in nature. Making pictures or jogging or just breathing talking with a person or be alone in my thoughts. 😊I see you added 2 more pictures to your profile. You are so beautiful Yan 😍To day is mothers day and yesterday I baked a cake or not a cake it's more a role 😂
I will send you pictures of how I made the role and later when I have more time, I will answer to your letter (I already read your letter and it's so kind what you wrote there ^^).哇！你真的太厉害了！Thank you Yan 😊is Mother’s Day celebrated worldwide today?我在外地上大学见不到妈妈，今天早上给她发了消息你做的蛋糕一定很美味！I'm not sure 😅 I don't think so 😅I hope so 😅☺️Today is also Mother’s Day in ChinaOh so you live a little bit far away from your mother? You miss her? 🥺Then it's worldwide :)Fortunately,I can return to her by June,and I can give her a video or phone callThat's good 😇hehe cute 🤭Are you feeling good? :)I’m resting today and I’m very happy.What about you?I have to do something else now. I’ll talk to you later.May l ask you a questionYes of course! :)I'm better and I'm kinda happy right now. There are still some sad emotions and thoughts left from friday, but I'm much better 😊

And it's good to hear that you are happy 😁See you later and I will wait for the question 😇I’m back!What happened to you on Friday that caused you to have a bad mood?if it’s convenient, please let me know and I would love to hear from you.😊☺️😝What I want to ask you is, can you understand Italian with half Italian descent? Many of the songs I sing are in Italian. I want you to listen to my Italian. It's a little embarrassing. Can you evaluate my language?Hehe hey ☺️

So yes on friday...I'm not completly sure why I was so sad.
But maybe it was because of the girlfriend of my brother.
On friday she visits us and it's always bad for my mood when she is here 😰
Because then my brother is only with her and in addition to add I see people in love and always think that I also want something like that 😅

And I changed myself a lot in the last half year and to be honest I just want to love 😅☺️ (but of course the right person) and it was kinda sad that it not happend yet...because it feels like I deserve it. I just have to be patient 😅🌹
...but yes that makes me sad on friday.Sadly no. I can't speaknor understand italian. I had lessons for only 2 years...so I only know the very basics 😅

But you often listen to italian music? You like it? Which songs do you listen to?

I listen to many different music songs but my favourite is epic music (that's powerful instrumental music).
They are most likely very long, so I will cut a part out of it for you. And I send you a pop song which I really like.
And in future I will send you even more songs (only if you like ☺️).
So I hope you will enjoy them ^^

We make pizza today...we often make pizza 🍕😂☺️
Maybe I will send you some picture from pizza...but will get hungry and envy 😏😏Bon Appetit ☺️😋Btw I heared your sended song like 50 times or more 😂
Now I will always think on you if I hear it 🤭

I will go to bed now. Good night Yan😊 (and soon good morning for you😂😝)Good night Tobia，I wish you a good dream😴😴（l have already got up for class)I appreciate the song you sent me when I return to the student dormitory after class.Thank you😊😊😊What flavors of pizza do you have ?🤤I’m going to class,The egg burger l had in the morningGood music, I see the MV is to express the couple’s love story? What’s the name of this song?🥰🥰🥰I love this epic music,give me a feeling of momentum grander,full of passion and surfing heart. Is this music from a movie or a game?

I will share with you a piece of background music of Chinese style this evening 😊

I really like the two pieces of music you shared with me🤗Good morning Yan ☀️ I just woke up 😴Yesterday we made pretty different ones. We made a zucchini pizza  with a creme fraiche sauce, a aubergine pizza 🍆 with aubergine sauce And we did "bella italia" which is tomato sauce, special cheese, tamatos, burata (a special more fluid mozzarella) and a special green paste/sauce.
 Oh and we did Pizza Diabolo. A normal margherita with spicy salami 🥵 (but it wasn't too spicy).

Yesterday I found the Pizza Diabolo the best😋😋Egg burger? Wow that looks so tasty...Can I have a bite? 🥹

And such a nice video and image 😍Aww thank you ☺️☀️☀️

Your broken english with your cute voice let's me melt 😂☺️☺️Oh music notes...that looks so difficult 😯🫣
How you can read them 😂
You are a genius😇

And the video was so cute 🥰
Your smile is beautiful 😍
And at the end where you made the fist...so cute 😊The song calls "Strangers Again" from GhostDragon and the song is a little bit sad, because he sings about that they don't love anymore and question himself why that happened. And he don't wants that they become strangers again...but maybe they can try it again when they become strangers again.
I find that kinda sad 😭I'm glad you liked it🤗...I really enjoy listen to epic music 😇
And I don't know if the music is from a movie 😅
I found it on youtube :)

And I'm waiting for the piece you want to send me ^^Have a nice day Yan!

And we understand us so well.
And you can relax me. And your voice. And you are damn beautiful...

The ending is that the man kills the woman because the female protagonist is a villain, and the righteous and villains cannot be together, so they can only be killed.I just want to cherish the person in front of me,because you deserve my sincerity towards you🥰Because l am very grateful to the  was a kind of fate that we met☺️😊Today is another day of struggle,good morning Tobia😄😁I won’t hurt you.You just need to be yourself and believe in yourself ☺️☺️😘😘The song I shared with you has occupied my entire high school years, healing and comforting me. Although the song is very sad, as soon as I hear it, I will remember my storyWatermelon 🍉 is very sweet😆Will you close one eye? I found that I couldn't do it.🤣🤣🤣🤣Good morning Shuyan ☀️😴☺️That is rice with vegetables but chicken would fit very well 😯😄

Yes the time will pass fast and you will be at home very quickly. Don't worry!

About 10 german commediants get locked in a room and must not laugh. And they try to make the others laugh...it can be very crazy 😂 But sometimes very funny 😂😝Oh really...that's a really interesting story 😯😭Aww ☺️👉🏻👈🏻

When you are too hungry, it will be better to drink water to relieve it. I'm sorry to say something wrong just now, because I don't know how to express Chinese 心疼in English. I searched it and it turned out to translate into I love you.🤣😂Don't get me wrong. You are my most cherished friend. I like you and friendship.💕🥰🥰l hope everything goes well with your workBe safe on your way home ☺️I really care about you.I'm now in the train ✌️🏻Alright I'm confused 😂 and no worries😂☺️Aww thank you 🥰 I only can say the same about you!

But I had such a good mood during the day 😇 Very nice!Hehe you are so cute🥰 I will take care 😇

My father said he waits for me at the trainstation and we will eat yufka there 😊😋
You know what yufka is? I will send you an image :)Ethics was kinda fun 😊 We discussed many things about who's responsible if as an example a company makes something wrong. The company? The boss? Maybe the user of a prodcut?
That can be a very difficult question and it depends on the situation.I'm sooo tired...I just want to eat something and go to bed 😊😴
I will rest now a bit and will write you later again 🥰Wow that was nice. That was the best yufka which I ever had 😋
And it was so kind of my father to come to the city and buy me a yufka ☺️
And then he drived me at home with his scooter (like a small motorcycle). That was very nice.
And he let me out a few meters from my home because he drived to a friend to watch football and my siblings shouldn't know that he done that else they would be jealous 😂😅🤫
-> I hope you understamd what I tried to say. It was difficult to describe 😅That's the yufka and wow it was so tasty and big and juicy 😱Now I'm a very happy boy ☺️
I just can lay on my bed, I had good lectures, a good dinner, funny moments and I talked with you...I can't wish me more than that 😊🥰🥹🥹 ohhh that's so lovely and kind and cute ☺️👉🏻👈🏻
You are way to good for me 🤭It's so crazy...my mood was soooo damn good today and the reason was you!😯☺️☺️

I'm sorry that I write you that much messages...but I have to say that😊
You have to know how positive you influence me 🥰

And someday I have to tell you about another thing...it's not a good topic and it has been with me my whole life...so I want that you know about it...but not today 😇I'm sorry I write you so many messages 😂
I just want to eat these 2 joghurts and watch a series and yes the image is funny 😂I ate too much 😂😂😝 I have bellyache😓...I'm so dumb 😂😂😂It feels so good to lay in my bed, watching a series and thinking on you ☺️
ahhh...so relaxing 😇That's so beautiful and relaxing...I hope it makes you feel relaxing and you enjoy it ☺️I can't move anymore...I'm too done 😂☺️😴

I will try to sleep now 😴
I hope you had and have a good night ❤️

I'm so happy to be at home 😇Thank you Tobia ☺️☺️you are really greatHahahahah,Good night have a sweet dream🥰🥰Today I want to share my story with you. 

When I was 12 to 14 years old, I was in junior high school. China's junior high school had to learn Chinese mathematics, English, political geography, history, chemistry, and sports. At that time, I learned very painfully, and my grades were poor. The content of junior high school was too difficult. The school required the first course at 6 o'clock in the morning, The teacher didn't like me because of my poor grades, often verbally insulting, beating, and hitting me. At that time, I was extremely insecure and lacked confidence. Because that environment makes me gasp for breath and very painful, I feel like committing suicide in pain. Moreover, there are many school rules that prohibit going out to play and require me to sit in the classroom to study. After class, I can only rest for 10 minutes. It has been many years now, but it has caused great psychological damage to me. Although I have undergone many changes now, sometimes I am not very confident. Before entering junior high school, I had a cheerful and lively personality. Since then, my personality has become completely like that of another person and I have become introverted. The major I am currently pursuing in college is music, which I have loved throughout my life and has cured me. The teacher values me very much, likes me, and I also like my teacher. Although university is also very difficult, I am very happy to study🤪I will share more song for you😊😊Look soooooo nnnnniiiicccceeee😍😍😍😍😍Every morning is the beginning of hope,remember to encourage yourself,show the charm of confidence. 
Good morning Tobia 🥰😘There is a passage in the Green Book: "A friend is the other self in the world, and we take off our masks in front of each other, doing what we want to do comfortably and freely, saying what we want to say, hoping that you can stand tall, see far, and be safe by my side every year🥰🥰🥰

And oh the boy has the same surname (family name) as you 🤭😊dinner time 😋Now I lay in my bed...it's so cozy ☺️😊🤭
And I thought on yesterday and on you 😊

Yesterday I saw many families in the zoo. And there I asked myself: "Do I want kids?".
I thought a lot because in my past I often thought: that's so stressfull and kids takes so much. But yesterday I added another component to that thought...and the component was you 😯
I thought: To have kids with a person you really like must the best thing in the world.
Go together in the zoo and have fun with your family. 
Looking in the eyes of the women you love, seeing her playing with your kid and seeing her happy 😇
After the zoo and after we bring the kids to bed, we lay in your bed. Let the stressfull day calm down. We look at each other. We kissing us and just are happy to have each other in our life.
Isn't that a nice thought?😅

I'm sorry I maybe overthink that 😂😂
I often overthink 😂😝
I have to stop 😂Good night ☺️

see you on the other side 😊😘Hahahah,Tank you Toiba🥰🥰I very like listen it,the climax of this song is grand and vigorous,l want to know what the background story is?😍😍😍😍Your photography skills are amazing!!!!😍😍😍
Nature and animals take beautiful photos.😘😘🥰🥰
Hahaha,photo 10is also too interesting,what’s this person doing 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣These photos are so beautiful,they really amaze me!
You’re awesome 😍😍You’re soooooooo cute and handsome,💋💋💋💋🥰🥰🥰😘😘😘😘I forgot the names of the people in the movie😂🤣what’s his name?Good appetite 🥰🥰😂🤣l have also thought about these issues before,and I want to have a child with my beloved,the child can have a child.☺️
But these are just fantasies,and now most people are not sincere,so I am very scared 😓🤣😂Good night 😘
hope you dream a beautiful dream 😊☺️Good morning Tobia 😝You said these is so beautiful that I can imagine it, I can feel happiness,whether you are alone or not,you’re a happiness boy🥰🥰
There are many emotions in the world,not just love😝😝
For example, I like you 🥰😘😆😆😋😋😋🤪🤪Good morning 😴☺️I don't know the background story but I'm happy you like the song 😇😊Oh wow thank you ☺️☺️👉🏻👈🏻

Thank you for the video message and the wish ☺️❤️Haha that's a nice video 😂😊😊I like it. I like you ☺️Hahahaha,you’re very cute 😁😆😆Wow! 很有创意，有趣🤣🥰yes yesThank you Tobia😘😘There’s a second part of this movie, which I think is even better 🥰🥰Nono, I have never been in love,but I think they are too hypocritical
From many examples of people around me there is no true love and the right view of love,because of a little thing and not satisfied want to break up,this is terrible 😨😰🤣🤣🤣🤣Yes, but I first have to finish the first part 😂 
I watched 1/4 and then it was dinnertime 😇
I will finish the movie today ☀️take your time,this movie is too long. I can’t understand it because I lack knowledge 😂😂🤣I understand, but don't think that all men are like that. Believe in love 🥰

But I sometimes I have the same feeling...so I can understand you 😰😂👌🏻Yeah yeah yeah,you’re such a good boy

The reason why love is fragile is that it does not really reach the level of love. Many people follow the pattern and take the form, which cannot reach the essence of love.🥰

That's interesting. Please tell me more 😯Hahaha,so take your time ,don’t worryWhat? 😂😊What?😳🤣🤣🤣可能我理解错了，我没理解你的意思😂
I asked if you could tell me more about what you said. Maybe an example or something like that. So that I can understand it ☺️Like what is the essence of love? 🥹okay🤣🤣😂😂Do you mean that many people just hav superficial love like have sex and don't have important values like trusting each other and such things?What l understand is that two people tolerate each other,make progress together,and solve problems in timeYes yes 🥰Yes,but但是中国的情侣，做爱我不知道，我的同学因为男朋友没有满足她们的物质需求而生气有问题就让男朋友猜，不直接表达出来男朋友猜的不正确女生就生气🤣🤣😂😂😂😅😅The world is too impetuous,should sink heartNo no!🥺
I know that feeling, but there are nice people and it's possible to find someone you really love and which whom you understand super well.

I don't find such a person either...but I don't stop believing 🥰I know, I always believeLike we understand us very very well 🥰 and I think if we would not live so far away we would be a perfect couple🥰Yes that's good 😘Yes yes,但是我认为距离不是问题😂🤣Not? 😯
You think there is another problem?As long as the heart together,how far will not be separatedoh wow 😳🥰 so romanticyeahI'm curious what you are writting 😂☺️我说的是成语，英语翻译不出来我想表达的意思😭😭😭😭😭oh no...I want to hear it 🥺😓事在人为This你如果学习了中文就明白什么意思了英语翻译不出来我想表达的大概意思是Human effort can achieve anythingAlright I understand 🥰
I will continue or start learning chinese ^^
The book arrived yesterday 😇Thank you TobiaI am also working hard to learn English 🤣🤣but wait a second...I'm confused.
What do you think about us?

Like I said that I think we would be a perfect couple...but ut's sad that we live so far away 😅
And you said, that love is bigger than this distance 😯

I'm curious. Do you see us more as good friends? Or more?

Just be honest and don't have fear to hurt me 🥰
We should can talk freely to each other 😇我对你说的每一句话从来没有说慌，因为我认为你是个很好的男孩子，我喜欢和你说话，现在阶段我们是朋友，但是我想努力的学习英语想和你的关系更进一步I want to go abroad in two years,我和我妈妈说过出国Oh really 😯☺️yeah，l didn’t lie to you,l don’t like liesIs that a question at the end? The translator confused me. Di you asked: you?I'm just at the way to my mini jobWhat?mean? I don’t understandOh ohThe translator said at the end: ...you
And I'm not sure if that is a question 😂Now I confuse you 😂And I'm happy to hear that. Yes let's be friends now and who knows what we will be in future ☺️

Yes the story is a bit confusing 😂Yes😂😂对不起，我只知道你焦虑了，但是我不明白你为什么焦虑Is that girl making you uncomfortable?Yes, no worries darling 😂☺️
The story wasn't about my anxiety. The topic was the chinese girl who loat her key 😂😅No no 😂 wait I try to explain again☺️I understand!Oh really? 😯Wait  my brother calls me她丢失了🔑，你害怕你的哥哥责怪你？okayOr if you go to a confined space alone,it makes you uncomfortableDid that girl confess her love to you?😱I'm backNo no. You missunderstood. I hadn't the anxiety because of her. I had the anxiety on the way to the zoo.
And that story with the key was after the zoo, there I was comfortable 😊What no 😂😝
We don't know us and I have only eyes for you 😂😘🤣It's difficult to say when I get the anxiety...I have to thinkI like listen you tell me😍🥰It's when I overthink and when I'm not have a private space where I can hide myself.

At home I'm fine because I can hide.😅

In a restauarant I often feel uncomfortable. You eat something and there are a lot of people and I don't have a private space 😰It may sounds weird to you, I can't understand myself at all...so...Oh my god , I understand how you feel 🥺🥺Are you feeling better nowAnd when I get anxiety I have so really bad feelings and bad thoughts.
I overthink everything and only can think on the negative things and it overwhelmes me我小时候我的爸爸妈妈出去工作，他们把我自己一个人留在家里，当时我4岁我一个人非常害怕，我哭了一天Yes yes. My anxiety can occur in one second to the next and can dissapear as fast as it cames..it's quiet weird 😂😰Oh no...poor girl 😰😰😭Don’t be afraid l ‘ll take with you😘🥰🥰Aww thank you so much ☺️😘
On thursday you helped me so much 😊🥰
I'm so glad to have you ❤️In long terms the only way to beat the anxiety is to be in public and try to stay calm and accept the bad feelingI thank you ,too🥰So the zoo and such things are very difficult but very helpful😇My battery charge is low again 😂🔋

Sleep well and we see us tomorrow 😊I make so many video messages 😂😂It follows a long message. Read it when you have the time. Don't make yourself stress darling 😊Can I speak freely about a topic which is currently occupying me? I know you sleeping right now and tomorrow you will have much to do, so I don't want to disturb you from anything. Just do what you want to do and read and answer if you have the time for it☺️ 
I don't want to disturb you😰☺️ 
 
I think I overthink it but I have to talk about it with somone and I trust you at most. 
I…I often have and had the feeling that I have to be the entertainer in a conversation/relationship. But it's difficult…sometimes I have no clue about what I should talk or what I should ask. I want to do something interesting. 
Like in our chat. I always try to do something interesting else I think you loose the interest and leave me 😥 
What if we met us in reallife and I don't know what to say? I don't want to loose you😰 
Sorry I overthink…but I can't stop 😰 
And I made myself thoughts like:…if we imagine we would be together for 5 years and see us every day, it's impossible to keep the attention and the degree of interest that high. 
In a relationship you can try to increase the level step by step at first. 
You watch a movie together, talk about different topics, first time holding hands, first time cuddling, first time touching and explore the other body, first time having sex and so on.  
All wonderful things but at any point you can't increase the degree of interest. And then you should break up?? That's not good...I don't like that thought. 
But what makes good couples keep being in a relationship?  
Alright…I think I think too much about it…I'm sorry…I hope you don't think wrong about me now. 
But maybe the whole thought is not important at all and I have to accept when I'm not be able to be interesting or increase the degree of interest. Maybe the thought is too superficial…puhh…I have to stop thinking… 
Maybe "good" couples are just there for each other in good and bad times. In interesting and boring times 😯 
Sorry…I don't know why I'm just are so negative and overthinking 😰 
I want to be happy but qt the same time I want to be completly honest with you ☺️ 
 
And don't get me wrong. I really enjoy our conversations and I hope it will never ends 😊☺️You desvered a bright and happy good morning when you wake up, so don't take the previous message so seriously. It's just me overthinking 😊😅 That sometimes happen 😂So good morning sunshine ☀️😊 
Have a nice day and work hard and rest well 🥰💪🏻 
May the sunshine and the good will fill your beautiful almond eyes, and will caress and warm your beautiful skin and your pretty face. And may the wind will play with your perfect hair and may the birds will sing a song about you and your wonderful beeing. Let the water washing your perfect body and may your will be like a hot and strong bonfire🥰😘 
Always know that I think on you, Shuyan. And always know that I miss you ♥️You might be confused why my mood is changed that much and it has 2 reasons. 
I'm happy to speak about the entertainer-topic with you and you deserved a positive mood. So here we are 😊 
Have a great day and we will see us later 😊🤣🤣I think you think too much, doing anything is not that complicated, I did not lose interest in you, but I have something to do so it is only short offline, and when I offline I tell you in advance what I go to do.🥰🥰

Thank you. I'm glad you told me thatI see😂🤣Good night,may the night be gentle,brushing your ever dream🥰🥰🥰
I will miss you

I wish you a good night 🥰🥰I will miss you ❤️🥰😘See you 
Gute Nacht,Tobia
I miss youGute Nacht 🥰 Sweet dreams🌈😘Yummy 😋I'm so full 😝 I ate slowly and much 😂I just helped my sister to catch a spider in her room. I kinda like these creatures 😂
If you have fear for spiders I'm your best friend.

As an example. A few months ago, where my sister lived a few houses away, she wrote me a message in the night. If I could come over and catch a spider.
She and her ex-boyfriend are really scared about spiders.
And so I got up, put something on and went to them. I felt like I would be a professional monster hunter😂
And I catched the spider easily.
They had so panic and was then so thankful to me 😂☺️

They said: "How could you go so near by the spider without fear??".
And I said: "She had more fear than I and she's a beautiful creature".

It's weird that I have no fear about them..
You know I'm an overthinker and have often anxious...but my anxiety is only about myself and what others think about me 😅Good night and I miss you 🥰😴😘Oh I tried to sleep but I found a song from my childhood 😰

That song makes me so sad 😭Somewhere only we know by KeaneThat makes me sad 😭

I shouldn't think on it. I will think on you. That always makes me happy 🥰

I will try to sleep again 😴I understand you,you tried ☺️😊😍🥰Good appetite!You mean you made this magazine?😲Too advanced, I can feel you’re happy!😄😄😄I'm afraid of insects, spiders and other creatures. You are so brave. Don't care too much about what others think of you. The diverse people in the world, no matter what others think, will not affect you, and you can't control what others think of you, that is, you are right, and there is something that can be criticized in the eyes of others. Don't care too much about other people's opinions, which will cause mental exhaustion. A few weeks ago, I wore a dress similar to a fishtail skirt to show my figure. A boy in our class said something unpleasant, saying that my waist was very thin and coquettish... I didn't do anything, just wore a skirt. It doesn't affect me at all. I will still wear my skirt. In fact, no one is perfect. Love yourself more than anything else. Life belongs to everyone's own feelings, not to anyone else's opinion, so you don't have to care too much about yourself in other people's eyes, and there is no need to change yourself because of other people's judgment.🥰🥰😘😘😘I miss you
I hope you sleep well 🥰😘You said great last two words,but what did you say first 😂🤣😂Poor boy,what happened to your childhood 🥺
Don’t think about sad thing🥰Is it the thing I know about ?Good morning 🥰😴
I'm so sleepy 😴😴I wish you a good day 😇
I hope your class is fine and you gain much knowledge 😊Oh and I saw that you often write "tried" but you should write it "tired" ☺️😘

(tried is the past form of try. Like: I tried to catch the bus. And: I was so tired that I slept in in the bus.)Ohhh no no 😂
I mean I like it and I get it monthly 😂☺️Haha 😇Thank you 🥰😘
Yes I will try to let the others think and say what they want and focus more on myself and on you ☺️

You are great 😊 You have to look so awesome in a skirt 😍☺️😘jiu hao mung 😜Oh no no. The song makes me just sad, because it remebers me on my childhood.
On the "good old times" 😅Yes I will not think about it ☺️
I will think about you instead 🥰我刚下课，一会儿回复你Yes ☺️ Take your time. Don't stress yourself, I will wait 🥰🤣😂🤣😂yes yes ,这两个单词长得太像了，我经常搞混😵‍💫😵‍💫我从早上7点一直忙到现在，吃完饭还要去排练，我慢慢回复你🥰🥰🥰等我

Good night ❤️Yeah,但是我现在还不能真正的入睡，我在解决问题，等一下我和你说😤😭😭Oh 😯 You don't have to sleep. So don't worry ☺️

And I'm curious what your problem is😯😯I'm the leader of the rehearsal team. I'm going to organize a rehearsal for tomorrow's holiday, and then I set the time at 10 o'clock. I don't think it's too early at all. Two of my classmates thought that the rehearsal time was too early to get up, so they asked me to change the time. I said it was not early I won't change the time. Don't make any excuse for laziness. I'm very angry that they are not serious when rehearsing at ordinary times. When the teacher checks, he will blame me for not leading a good team. I can't refute and explain, as long as the result.Oh really 😰 I hope they will take it seriouly tomorrow 😰

You are a good leader, so I hope you don't will get blame because of them 😰I'm speechless to people who can only make excuses.Soooo difficult!They can't get up in the morning. I can't change the time because of a few people. I said what I should say. It's their problem whether they listen or not.😓Yes you are right. You are angry and that's your good right.

10 isn't early 😅They have ti get up there...what should you do there...You did the rightit's their loss not to rehearse,sooo lazy😅😨😰Why is 10 O'Clock to early for them?? That's a good time.
I will get up at 7 O'Clock tomorrow....I play piano for them and lead them in practiceI will get up 6 o’clockOh wow, so you can play piano 😂you are admirableI play the piano and singI don’t understand themTry not to think too much about them. You can't change something...Yes,这句话听起来像我😂😂🤣Hehe and it sounds like me 😂🥰我不关心她们了，因为我已经下发通知了What did you? 😂You don't care anymore about them because what?我在上午发的通知，通知明天早上的排练，她们晚上和我说要我改变时间，这怎么可能Oh yes that's impossible for the othersBecause I am angry 😅😂🤣I understandHehe yes, that's the first time I see you angry 😂😯The usual practice attitude,let me speechlessYes I understand that...why are they so lazy...they sound like me 😂😂Sorry Tobia,我希望我不好的情绪不要影响到你🥰😘No no I would do that. I would be there at 10 O'Clock 😇nono，不是你🤣🤣Don't say sorry because of your feeling 🥰
You are a human and have feelings and I like to see that ☺️Thank you for you understand meOf course ☺️You can tell me everything 😊更主要的原因是，平时排练她们不认真，她们练的很差，上课表现也不好导致老师会质问我But why that's your fault??我平时劝告她们，你们多练习，不听，我忍耐很久了You didn't something wrong 😰因为我是组长😅Yes...but when they don't care you can't change it 😓
It sounds not fair...YesYou should forget them and should try to sleep 🥰

You have to get up early tomorrow ☺️Thank you Tobia,我现在很开心谢谢你愿意听我说话Really, I'm happy to hear that ☺️☺️I go to sleep nowPay attention to safeOf course I do. I really care about you and your problema are my problems 🥰I wish you sweet dreams ☺️😘I will do 🥰Thanks for your hand work 🥰😘

This is an ancient music created by ancient Chinese poetry. The meaning of the poem is: When the willow catkins fall and the cuckoo crows, I heard that you were demoted to Longbiaowei, and the remote place of Longbiao has to pass through Wuxi. I entrust my sad thoughts to Mingyue, hoping to accompany you all the way to the west of Yelang. The author of this poem is Li Bai. I like this music very much. The girl's singing style is Chinese opera. This time my sharing is different from before. You should have different feelings. What do you think of this music? I want to hear what you think, because I don't know if you can accept this kind of song. This is the first time I've shared Chinese opera with you.Ohh interesting. I will listen to it soon. I'm sitting with my family so I can't listen now.

This idiom originally refers to the ideal state of isolation from the real society and the peaceful life. Later, it also refers to a quiet and comfortable place to live. It is used as a metaphor for a fantasy, isolated and detached place from the real society. In a word, I think you are very happy and I envy you.what is paradise?Okay🥰😘Ohhh 🥰

We make now Calzone. Do you know what that is?

It's a pizza but folded. I will send you pictures ☺️It tasted very well 😋I just felt a bit anxious...I don't know why... and had an idea.
I would like to tell you more details about my anxiety. I told you very much, but I think there are some more things to tell you and I want that you understand me better 😊
It will be a long story, so read it when you have the time. Don't stress yoursefl to reply to it 👌🏻

So let us start at the beginning of my anxiety which is in my childhood.
There I had some bad experiences. And it's not easy for me to talk about it.
I find it very embarrassing...but yes...I always want to tell you everything.
I didn't even tell my therapist everything 😰
I couldn't.
Sooo...as a child I made some bad experiences with eating and public.
For example, I was in an Asian restaurant and I got so sick from the intense smells that I had to threw up outside. My sister kindly accompanied me back then.
I'm so embarrassed about that.
Another example is a holiday trip. Before we start our trip with the car, we ate Yufka/Döner (this turkish food, you know?). And the sauce was so greasy and gross and I was nervous about the holiday.
After we started the car ride, I had to throw up in the car...
A similiar story happened on the drive from Karlsruhe back to my home.
Only difference was that it was a burger from mc donalds.
Alright and there is another story...it's kinda the core of my fear and it's my worst story...I think I couldn't tell you the story...I only can write you it.
It's...it's really difficult for me to tell you that story...
I'm ashamed of that story.
It was in my primary school and was very very young. Our class were sitting in a chair circle. I noticed that I didn't feel good. I was ill? I ate something wrong? I don't know. But I wanted to go to the bathroom...but I was too shy to ask 👉🏻👈🏻
I don't wanted to interrupt someone.
And so I threw up in fornt of everyone. And...and...I don't know how to say that...
I turned away at that moment, to my brother and he got something then...sorry that's so embarrassing...I hate myself right now...and it's very emotional for me.
I wanted to die in that moment and I still want when I think on it 😭
That were all sories from my childhood. Then later I had problems to eat in restaurants. I got anxiety and bad thoughts.
I was anxious to do something embarrassing and that other will think bad of me because of that.
Over the years the anxiety grown up and took more and more place in my life.
In high school it was at it's peak. 
I couldn't go anywhere without a bag. The bag was an emergency item in case I had to break up. Because I was afraid to vomit without any reason. That actually never happened, except back then in my childhood, otherwise never, but I was still afraid of it...at that time there was no apparent reason, so how did I know that something like that couldn't happen again.
So I was afraid and panicking everywhere outside of my home.
At some point I also noticed this anxiety at home and was beset by negative feelings and panicked thoughts.
I had to fight every day and was always attacked by anxiety.
Every Monday I had to vomit from excitement. Because it was Monday and because we had school sports that day and I was afraid of what other people would think and say (although I actually enjoy sports).
It became routine.
At some point I panicked on the bus and could only take the train.
I have always perceived my world as more restricted and darker.
A little later I couldn't take the train anymore. I had gone blind, so to speak. I was in my tunnel vision, created and controlled by anxiety.
At this point I didn't know what to do anymore and then went to the therapist. This helped me to perceive the world again and to give way and withstand the grip of anxiety.
The advances were sometimes smaller, sometimes larger. Sometimes I also took steps backwards.
Once I took a very big step backwards during the exam phase.
But overall I was able to do more and more. Was eventually able to leave the bags at home and take the bus and train again.A few months ago I took another giant leap and suddenly realized what it feels like to live without anxiety. Sitting on the train and not being scared, not having to fight it, not being harassed by "wrong" thoughts. That's so beautiful 😭
And I try a lot and fight hard.
Restaurants are still my supreme discipline, but I'll crack that too.
Anxiety and panic and negative thoughts still come up every now and then, but I endure them and fight against them.
I feel like I'm learning something new every week and getting stronger (even if there are also steps backwards) 😊
Like yesterday sleep outside.
And you help me so well through that process Shuyan ♥️

Ok...so that's the whole story of my anxiety. Because of my anxiety, I also spent a lot of time at home and spent a lot of time gaming. In the virtual worlds I could escape and didn't have to endure any anxiety there.
I'm glad I have my family and that I'm actually a very positive person and I thank god for having you Shuyan 🥰♥️...otherwise I probably wouldn't win against my anxiety.
That's it...I'm curious what you will say about it. You can speak and ask freely 😇
Do you think, you know more about me after this message?Currently I kinda feel a little bit ill. I'm tired and it feels like I have fever (but I don't have fever).
It was exhausting to finish the text, but I wanted to write it for you..the translator helped me 😜

Now I'm done. I will drink something, clean my teeth and will try to sleep. I will join your dreamworld haha ☺️Good morning ☺️☀️

Give your best, study hard and don't forget to rest 🥰I miss you ❤️I'm glad that you can tell me your feelings, because I don't want Tobia to bear it alone. Although I can't do anything, I will always be with you. Whenever you are the best and most special one for me. Don't be afraid. Nothing in life is smooth sailing. Life is not good for us. At worst, if we try harder, everything will always pass. I understand your inner pain and sadness very well. You are a kind and sensitive child (me too hahahaha). Don't ignore the feeling that you always take care of others. You need to be yourself. You are just sick. These are not embarrassing. If you are sick, you have to be treated. Don't be afraid. In fact, people don't need too many things to live in this world. It's good to live healthy and love sincerely. You don't have to be satisfied with everyone. It's always you who can define you. So what if your grades decline, so what if you don't have a job? If you are tired, you can not work hard. You can do what you like or send me a message. Hahahaha, I'm willing to listen to everything you say. You just have a cold. It's nothing. Those who love you will always accompany you and go through difficult times. Believe me, the sun rises and the moon sets, and there will always be a dawn.🥰🥰🥰I'm happy for you. You should thank yourself even more. The most difficult thing is to defeat yourself. You have made a big step to success! Take your time, everything will be fine.🥰🥰🥰你不要让自己太累，你应该多休息
晚安💤Good morning, thank you,我很好，主要是你多休息哈哈哈是的，我从你的眼睛里看出来你很疲惫You’re so cute,🥰🥰我看到你我不自觉的笑了，谢谢你看起来太棒了！！！我玩了一款游戏，和做披萨一样，给你看一下😋😋😋😋😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣谢谢你Tobia，我很开心你告诉我的一切，我是你很好的聆听者，因为你我觉得我的生活也变的更好了，比如说心态和生活变得更积极了，感谢你的出现，🥰🥰🥰🥰😘😘晚上我分享给你我的故事，这对我来说并不是好的故事🥲Good morning!In fact, you are very good. You are very strong, but sometimes you don't find it. You should encourage yourself more.☺️😊My mother's own sister's son, also my cousin, is about to get married. It's a pity that I can't attend his wedding because of my studies. My brother usually takes good care of me, because he works in Beijing, and I also go to school in Langfang. It takes about an hour and a half to Beijing by bus. I performed in Beijing two months ago. I couldn't go back to school without a bus at 10:30 in the middle of the night, so I went to my brother's house to stay. It's really warm to have a family in a strange city. I'm very happy to see him happy.Wow...thank you soooo much ☺️
You are so kind and cute 🥰
And you help me so well 😇

I'm glad I told you it, because you are the most special and only girl for me🥰☺️

And I know that anxiety is sometimes difficult to understand for others because you can't see anything...but you are so supportive and try to understand 🥰
I liked your last sentence to calm down 😊谢谢你，我明白焦虑症的痛苦，你只是生病了。别人不理解没有关系因为他们根本不懂The main thing is that you understand me🥰Thank you ^^Yes，l will support youHaha 😂😘

You are so amazing!我有我自己擅长的东西，不想背束缚，尤其用成绩😅Singing?I have now coffee and cakeThank you Tobia,我现在还有我初中老师的联系方式，虽然我讨厌她，但是每到过节日的时候我都发消息问好，说一些祝福语，我的同学还问我，她当初那样对你，你还去给她发祝福语？可是我想的是她也可能为我好，想让我进步，她就是那样的方式。站在不同角度想会不一样Yes😁Go ahead and eat,get back to me later 🥰😘I will waitOh really?

(Btw your festivals sounds awesome 😂🥰)Yes I made it quick so I can write with you. I know you go to bed soon ☺️And yes I ate enough :)怎么说，对我来说是过去了，我发消息不代表原谅，她自己也有孩子了，如果她的孩子经历过了就能明白我的妈妈是多么痛心我，我妈妈很痛心我她当时认为把我送过去读书是错误的😂🤣不要着急，无论多晚我都会等的
Than you Tobia🥰🥰😘😘Haha, you cutie 😂🥰🥰Yes I understand that. I missunderstood that. It's good that you are kind but not easily forgive herI have become a strong stress resistance and adaptability. It's good to be alone. I also want to thank her.😂🤣Of course!Ohh yes. I feel the same about my anxiety. It made me who I am now. It made me stronger by making me weaker 😂😅
And it makes me more sensitive ☺️

So I kow what you mean你现在又焦虑了吗？No I'm fine ☺️ I write with you and I'm very happy 😇因为环境会改变一个人，造就了我们，I understand you.因为曾经的不幸，需要一生去治愈所以不要害怕，我们一起面对Awww, yes let's do that 🥰❤️

-> The game calls "Dead by Daylight" and I have pretty much knowledge in that game 😂😜

In short: 4 survivors try to escape against one killer and all people are real people, so no ai or something like that.
And the killer tries to sacrifice all 4 survivors.

Do you know the killer? 😂
-> You know the killer from a series!

我虽然不知道这款游戏，但是我在网上看到过类似的生存游戏，中国也有，我玩过第五人格🤣😂I had a fantastic dream last night, just like watching a magic movie, hahaha. I forgot why I couldn't find the way, so I searched for navigation. The journey is expected to be 48 minutes away from home. I made the light rail. The light rail is so beautiful that it is open air. I took out my mobile phone and recorded it. I dreamed that I would send you a message. I said, Tobia, look, it's so beautiful here, hahahahaha. I remember that the sky was very blue. I sat there taking pictures. The light rail is open without windows. I remember that the light rail is very fast, and I flew out immediately.😂🤣😂🤣😂I'm confused. Do you dream of strangers when you dream? Yesterday, I dreamed of a lot of people I didn't know in reality. They looked very fierce, like the bad guys in the movie.😂🤣😂🤣I was so tired that I went back to my dorm to rest after class, I got up later than usual this morning, I was still sleepy 😂🤣🥲There is a movie called the little Mermaid coming out recently, I want to see it very much 😂🤣But it has not been released in mainland China.I am still busy this afternoon, I'll reply to you when I'm done.🥰😘🥰😘😋😋😋I was so sleepy in the morning that I went to bed again at noon.

I would love to dream about you instead 😘Yes that's my channel 😂😂 That's just a fun channel...nothing serious ☺️I'm glad you like it ☺️
That was a funny round and I did some really good moves 😜😂

I'm curious about how it will feel after watching it.It must be very special for you, because I'm afraid you can't accept it. I'm not used to it, but it's really good. This play is very classic in China.Haha don't worry 😂😘
And yes it's pretty different and I'm not sure about what the tv show is about exactly 😂
Like they show the emporer and his decisions and something like that 😅
I will continue ☺️I won't spoil you.🥰😘😘我希望你能喜欢我现在要去练习了，see you laterYes, have fun! 🥰See you later ☺️I finished the first episode ✌️🏻

It's so much about love and it's so interesting to see the chinese culture...food and cloths 😍

It remembers me on you. You sended me a picture of you in traditional look. 
But you are so much more beautiful as the girls in the tv show 🥰
You are so gorgious ☺️😘

I have a question. Did I understood it right, that all selected girls will have sex with the emporer? 😯😂
That's too wild 😂😂

And if a girl gets a flower she is not selected? 😯
For me itales more sense if the selected girls get a flower 😅2. Breakfast 😂😜Today I will go to Freiburg (a city) with my fatherDon't forget to rest after your practising! ☺️
You have to be very tired!🥰我回来了，我太累了。忙到没有时间吃晚饭Thank you. ☺️😊🥰😘
Ancient Chinese emperors will have a lot of women, polygamy, but the real wife can only be one person, having sex and having children. This TV series will not be filmed. China does not allow it hahahaha.I hope you have a good time🥰🥰😘😘I miss youThank you🥰😘The clothes I wore at that time were the Tang Dynasty, and this TV series was in the Qing Dynasty.However, I have seen the American version. This TV series has a total of 78 episodes, but it has been deleted a lot for foreigners' better understanding, so I think some stories are incomplete. But it's still wonderful.🥰😘Are you travelling in the city with your father?I reply to you later 😘Yeah,have fun🥰🥰
Don't worry, I'll wait for you😊This is a photo of me at the age of 18. I think I was too thin at that time, and it's better to be fatter now😁😁😁I tried some pants for the summer ^^I think we will go at home soon ☺️trousers are very suitable for you. They look good😍😍😍Yeah 🤗Thank you 🥰🥰Yes I was with my father in a city (Freiburg) and now we drive back at home ✌️🏻🥳Oh wow, you are so beautiful 🥰😍

And yes I think it's healthier to have more weight. I love you like you are ☺️😘What? To busy to have dinner? You didn't eat something 😱Haha,thank you Tobia

You're right. Health is the most important thing. Health is the capital of the physical revolution (old Chinese words)😁😆🥰😘Oh alright, so what they will do? 😅
I'm confused. I thought they make new generations 😅

Maybe I will know if I continue the series 😅是的，我们练习和排练很久，结束之后我吃饭了Ah good good ☺️

You have ti be very very tired 😴🥰我来解释yes :)Oh 😯 you really can say that so exactly ☺️So cute 🥰 I missed you too ☺️Because China at that time was ancient, in order to pass on the descendants of the clan, the constitutional monarchy was adopted in ancient times. But this play is not particularly real in ancient times, but the plot is good. If you want to see a very real movie called The Last Emperor.Ohh I think I understand 😇
I will search for this movie ^^🤣😂 Tobia has watched so muchI think I found him 🤔👌🏻我希望你喜欢这不是任务哈哈🥰😘Yes今天我看了它还没有看完，看完心里沉甸甸的Oh so you get emotional when you see it? ☺️No, It feels that things are different from people, and the changes in history are worth people's reflection😂🤣中国最后的王朝落幕，中国最后一个皇帝Yes yes...sounds interesting 😯😇I will watch it 🥰If you feel bored, you can not watch it, because I'm afraid you can't accept it

All female dogs have this phase 2 times per year and in this phase they can get pregnant and they loose blood.
And I don't want blood on my bed 😅...so she have to stay downstais 😅Hehe 🥰 Thank you 😘😋😋我想问你一个问题，你的母狗每个月会来生理期吗？和女人一样吗？还是母狗的生理期和人不一样？哈哈哈是的，血不好清洗The female dog is twice a year, and I have gained more knowledge😁😁I try it again...milk 😂😂Haha 😂😂 The translation is funny but I understand 😂Didn't you say you had a stomachache yesterday? you tried it again today😝😂🤣😂🤣😂Yes 🥺👉🏻👈🏻😂😂😂You are a warrior👍🤣It's her period. She has 2 times in a year her period, that's ehy she loose blood. And in after 3 weeks of her period she can get pregnant if she has *** with a male dog. So dogs have only 2 times in a year their periods, not so often as humans (I think so, maybe you can answer that better than I 😂😂)I don't know how different or equal the period of a dog and human is. I only know that the timing is different 😅
But interesting question 😅Ohohohohoh, I understand,thank you我获得了新知识！哈哈哈哈😂Haha 😂☺️Women come once a month, of course, twice or not. Dogs come twice a year😂🤣😂Ohhhhh 😱😰 I'm sorry 😰

With the passage of time, it will gradually get better😘I'm just a little annoyed by my family 😅😅I understand you 😂🤣But you still love your family very much when your troubles are overWe will seeNo no I'm joking 🤣Of course I love them ☺️You'll be fine in a while🥰Yes, I knowThank you 🥰I would like to take a walk, but I think it's too hot 😅😅我们是一样的，有时候我也烦，但是我好爱他们Yes, we are often so similiar ❤️☺️You can stay in your own room, do what you like, or look out of the window, or find a shady place to be quiet🥰At most I like to write with you 🥰Yes, maybe that's a good idea 😇

But don't feel used 😰👉🏻👈🏻What used?I can try to explain:
I use you if I only write you to get functional use out of you.

You know what I mean?I would feel used if someone only writes me if he/she feels bad我认为这不是利用你是说是写给很多人？What? 😂🤣No no 😅If someone would write you only if he feels bad. You would probably feel used. Because the person only writes you, if he needs your help.

So I said: Please don't feel used我不明白怎么说，我认为感情不能用利益来看，包括友情，亲情，爱情，如果只看利益是会伤害人的。当然，友情有时会这样。但是我不会看别人怎么对我，我只想问心无愧问心无愧是个成语，我不知道翻译器会翻译成什么Oh yes yes...I'm suprised...yes...you are such a kind person ☺️我不会这样认为啊，我是会想他或者她认为我重要，跟我关系好才会和我诉说，那她或者他为什么不选择别人而选择我呢？I understand :)Yes...that's true 😯I'm suprised 😯Do you understand?yes, I do是分情况的你现在会认为你是在利用我吗？我没有认为你在利用我No no I don't use you ☺️
I share all with you, positive as negative as all other things with you 🥰我是想让你明白，这不是利用😂😂我很愿意倾听Do you understand?😂 yes I don't use you. I share my negative things with you, because I trust you at most and I know that you will help me ☺️Like that? 😅你跟我说什么我都愿意听啊I know,thank you for telling me🥰😘I'm a little bit confused right now 😂😜分享不是坏事，无伦消极还是什么🥰😘Yes ☺️ But there are negative things 😂🤣I mean, I'm willing to listen to whatever you say to me.Oh yes, thank you 🥰It's normal🥰世界上没有任何一个人是一直保持好的情绪，喜怒哀乐是人生常态是需要自我调节，没有什么难事，一切都会过去心情像天气一样雨过天晴I laying now in my bed and I would like to tell you about something. 
I won't hide anything 😇
But I'm not sure...but I will tell you...

I often wanted to tell you but I wasn't sure how you will react...because I don't want that you think bad of me...but the truth is most important :)我喜欢诚实，只要诚实我都会接受🥰😘你还没有说你怎么知道我什么反应Give me a second to write the text and yes that's true, I don't know how you will react 😅你快说😂🤣你别让我猜我的脑子现在想的是你有别的女人了？No you don't have to guess. I have to write. Give me a moment 😂OkayNo no😘 

It's about a "relationship" in my past.我还以为是什么事情呢，你有一段恋情这很正常啊大家都是成年人，青少年有过一段爱情这没有什么的Yes yes but just let me write my story...I want that you know everything...else I feel badYou sayBefore we both met I chatted with another girl. She was kind but we don't had a connection like we both have. 
But after some time we wrote about sexual things...it was a really new experience for me. And after some time she asked something really weird. 
She...she said that she wants to see me cum...and I was like: "Wait...what? No no" I mean I never did something like that before...but I felt lonely and so I really did it. 
And she liked the video. 
I know...shame on me 😰 I'm so sorry. It was dumb. 
And a few days later she tells me that she had a similiar conversation with another boy and she find it boring and that there are many other girls on Discord and co where I can write like that...I was so confused and felt abused from her. 
She asked me for that and she liked it. 
I think she just get what she wanted and was finish with me...that felt so badly...I felt like the biggest idiot in the world and I thought I will never trust a person again. 
And then I met you. And it was so different and special with you 🥰 
And I know you are the right person and she was forgotten like a old bad story. 
 
I'm so sorry I would like that this never happened...but it happened...so I want that you know it... 
What do you think about me? I'm of course only your boy 🥺 
Do you think bad of me? I'm sorry...I just felt lonely 😰 
I learned a lot from this experience. 
You can ask me any question. I will answer you honestly 😇 
 
I feel so bad...because my love should only be yours and that's to 100% the case. In the time of the story we both don't knew each other. 
Now I know you and my love is to 100% yours...I give all of my love to you ❤️

I have to take a shower to get rid of that smell 😅Are you now?I laying on my bed and wear only my underpants so it would be easy to go to the bath right next to me and take a shower 😂👌🏻你说起洗澡，我也想洗澡，但是我不能洗澡，我的月经还没有结束，我感觉自己很脏有腥臭味😰😭Oh 😰
You can't take a bath with your period? 😰
Poor girl 😰😘

Hehe that can't stop me from loving you 🤣😘😘😘我给你科普一下月经的血是不可控制的流淌Yes science 😂😇如果我洗澡，我可能会生病，会感染细菌，所以我不能洗澡，不过我快结束了，明天就可以了Oh wow...yes that's new knowledge 😯😯

Thank you :)Yes soon it's over ☺️☺️Yes给你看看我每个月月经的时间，都不固定Ohhh thank you 🥰😘It's really amazing😂🤣yes...it's interesting for me...it's a complete other world 😅

I don't have such things as a boy 🤣😅什么是没有像男孩那样的东西？
你是个男孩啊What? 😂🤣🤣

No no, mean a boy don't have all of this...no period...have not to plan anything 😅😅Ohohohohoh, I understand 😂😂😂I thought on if there is anything bad or unpleasant for a boy...maybe you only could say that an erection in public feels a bit uncomfortable 🤣
But that's not comparable with your real pain 😅什么是勃起？？This is my blind spot of knowledgeWhen I have dysmenorrhoea, I may have been in bed for two days. It really hurts too much. My back hurts, and my stomach also hurts😭😭😰ohhh umm...alright...I don't know how much you know about men 😅
It's alright 😘

So...how can I say it 😂
A penis in his "idle state" is smaller and more soft and only is hanging there 😅
And if you stimulate a penis, like because you having sex with an women or rub it, it will be harder and bigger. And this is called an erection.
And a erection can appear randomly and that can be a bit awkward if that happens in public...I don't want that anyone notice it 🤣 But it don't hurts...it feels kinda good 😅😅
Soo it is not really bad 😅😂

And to be honest...I just have an erection 🤣
You know it's very often that men have an erection at the morning...I don't understand why, but there is a scientific answer why this is like that.
So when I wake up I often have an erection 🤣🤷🏻‍♂I'm so sorry 😭❤️我都没有谈过恋爱，而且我之前也没有和男人讨论这个话题😂🤣😂🤣一无所知，现在我知道了😂🤣谢谢你Don't worry ☺️
It's kinda cute that you don't know about it 🥰

You can aske anything 😜😇Thank you🥰😘这些不羞耻，都是生理现象。只要不是在公共场合…被发现就太尴尬了😂🤣Haha yes yes 😂👌🏻If you want I can even tell you more ☺️
But only if you want 😇你还想告诉我什么？你难道之前和女人做过爱吗？😱No never ☺️But I'm curious how it feels like 😂🥰I can tell you about the orgasm of a men ✌️🏻Don't be too curious. It will hurt yourself and others😂🤣这些我都不知道，我感觉我打开了新世界Haha 😂😅 Don't worry 😘
I don't expect too much ☺️😂😂😂 hahah 😂So you want that I tell you about it?Be loyal to your character and love yourself,and can't be a casual man🥰😘因为我害怕你被别人骗What do you mean? 😯You cheating on me? 😯😯我的意思是，通过你昨天告诉我的事情，我很害怕你受到伤害我没骗你你想什么呢😂😂😘😘😘只是告诉你，需要擦亮眼睛Yes yes I trust you 😘Thank you 😘So you didn't answer on my question 😇
Should I tell you about men orgasm? 😂You say不过我很好奇，你没有性生活你是怎么知道这些的？😲Huh? You mean, how I can know about the orgasm even I had no sex?YesyesyesMen have orgasms, do women have orgasms?Haha good question. So let me tell you how it works.

If you have an erection (as a man), your penis is hard. If you now stimulate your penis. Like having sex. At some point the men will have his orgasm. The penis is so stimulated that he will release his semen. The process of it is often called "cumming". 
The cum/the semen is are white liquid something 😅

And how do I know that?
You can also stimulate your penis by rubbing it with your hand.
And...and most men do that everyday....like me 
☺️👉🏻👈🏻Good question...we have to find it out together 🤣
As I know women also have orgasms ☺️ But I don't know 😅Wow!!,!🙀我又涨知识了我自己是女人我也不知道🤷🤣😂 good good. You can ask anything if you find something weird or something like thatYes 😂 We will find out 😊YesyesyesI would have a question 😅
Like I said that men / I mastrubate daily. (mastrubate is the process of rubbing yourself to an orgasm...you know?) 

But what's with you. It sounds like you never mastrubate yourself. I'm curious 😯Really???我都不知道，我只知道我马上来月经的时候，我的乳房会有点痒不舒服有没有一种可能是我还在发育…听你这么说我摩擦一下，一点感觉都没有…Wait what? Why you say: really?
I have the feeling you missunderstood somwthing or I told something wrong 🤣🤣谁没什么事会抚摸自己的乳房啊😂🤣😅我说真的吗是因为我不知道🤷，我第一次听你说Ok wait wait I'm confused 😂😜你迷惑什么I'm not sure how you understood what I said 🤣我明白你说的你所说的自慰我是真的不知道🤷我头一次听说，而且你比我懂得还要多😂🤣Haha yes yes 🤣😘什么乳房摩擦我也第一次知道我只知道我要来月经的时候乳房不舒服有点痒而且我是平胸女，还在发育…So men mastrubation is rubbing the penis, girl mastrubation is rubbing and fingering your vagina not your breasts 😘You are so cute 🤣😘😘……what？😱That's fine 😘😘really？As far as I know...yes 🤣😘😘好可怕😱Haha 😅😅 I understand you 😅好吧，我是没有什么感觉，我对性是尊重的😂🤣我只知道要保护自己，不干净会生病的，而且抚摸阴道……月经就是从阴道流出的啊😱😱I was so scared where I had my first orgasm. It was at a age of 14 or something like that.
I just "played" with my penis because it felt good and when I saw the white liquid...I was shocked 😱😱😱Maybe you can't mastrubate during your period 😅什么东西不能吃啊.我知道不能吃凉的前几天我嘴馋喝了上次我和你说的芒果饮品，喝完我就不行了，疼死我What do you mean? 😂Oh oh 😰 So it was too cold你不是问我在月经期间不能吃东西吗？我问你不能吃什么？No no I said that you maybe can't masturbate during the period. (Masturbate by women = rubbing/fingering the vagina)你怎么知道这么多😱😂🤣我很震惊I don't know it...I just guess 🤣And I sometimes watch porn videos 
🥺👉🏻👈🏻

So some things I know from them.

If you don't like that I can quiet them, I promise!这是你的权利，谢谢你告诉我，我涨知识了🥰🥰😘总有一天会明白这些的Oh 😯 wow ☺️😘What you will understand one day? 😅我可没说我不喜欢，人总会经历这些会明白性Do you understand ？Yes...I thought you don't would like it 😯I'm not sure🤣我是个思想开放的人，不过我有底线和原则，例如不随便和男人做过分的事情，也不会做，我自己和我喜欢的人在一起Yes that's good 🥰😘You are a very good person ☺️我相信你也是I think I should be more like you...I maybe shouldn't watch porn 😰
And I shouldn't masturbate so often 😰

It's just that it feels so good and I often feel a strong desire 😰
I often can't resist against it 😭I understand you,你是个人😂🤣人有七情六欲很正常，你不用责怪自己你又没有做过分的事情我的底线和原则是，忠于爱人，自己，不触碰底线的事情和道德You are awesome ❤️恪尽职守是个成语，我不知道翻译会翻译成什么我来解释🤣😂Yes explain 😇It means to do your job well and strictly abide by your job. For example, what role you play in the family is to be yourself and be filial to your parents. If you are a husband, you should be a good husband to love your wife and be loyal to marriage, which is similar to this meaningDo you understand?Yes I understand 😇
Yes yes 👌🏻

And I will be a loyal husband ☺️😂😂But I want to ask again. Is it ok for you if I masturbate? 
Or not?😅😂你自己的事情，你问我做什么😂😂这个没有必要来询问我吧🤣🤣🤣But it feels like I have to ask you 🤣是你自己的生理需求Yes...I don't know 🤣

I will now ask everytime when I'm about to masturbate I will first ask you 😉😂😂😂😂😂🤣这个我没有办法回答你，我不排斥，是你自己的事情😂🤣That's a yes 😂😂😘Can I tell you another thing? 😂你说难道又是性？？What?🤣没什么，You sayUmm...when I masturbate I sometimes just imagine to be with you and to experince with you 🥰

You know I have a rich fantasy 😇😂What?你在幻想和我一起做爱？？还是什么Umm 👉🏻👈🏻
Yes...🤣😂😳You are awesome🤣Oh 🥰😘 I wasn't sure if that is weird 😅I don’t know 😂🤣我幻想过和你旅游但是没有想到做爱这件事，不在我的头脑范围Haha 🤣 Maybe it's because I'm a boy...boys a monsters 🤣🤣Oh oh😂My hottest thought is how we would have sex the first time 🤣😳
Like undress each other. Touching each other.
Exploring and having fun ☺️

Sorry that's too wild 🤣😜你真的疯了😂🤣咱们转移一下注意力，做点别的事情！！例如出去玩，学习，提升自己做点有意义的事情Haha 😂😘😘
Yes I understand you. You don't feel the desire and it have to seem to be weird 😅
I'm sorry 😰So cute好吧，我的欲望没有很强烈🤣😂🤣😂But I understand you你很渴望😂😂

Oh wait, do you have fear that you would not reach my expectations?Be honest!什么意思？I don’t understandDo you think that I will be disappointed...that it isn't so good as I think it is? That you can't satisfy my imaginations?

You understand?我还是不明白😂 Alright...umm...wait...😅I ask you, if you have fear that I imagine sex with you as a really really good thing and you have fear that you can't fulfill my imaginations? 
Do you have fear that the sex wouldn't be as good as I think and I will be disappointed or something like that?Can you understand? 😂Yes我没有害怕啊Alright good 😇我的意思是说在我的脑子里没有想过做爱的事情😂🤣😂Haha 🤣 That's interesting ☺️我喜欢生活，幻想过和你一起吃美食，旅游，看日落…In my head there is sex 🤣 But I would like that there is no sex 😅I also fantasize about such things with you ☺️😊但你是有欲望的Yes 😰👉🏻👈🏻没关系，我理解我现在要化妆一会儿出去拍集体照See you laterYess I remember 😇You will look awesome 😍I wish you fun! ☺️See you laterAre you afraid that I'm to sex focused? 
That our vision from our relationship is too different?

And alright, I don't want to visit Thailand 🫣

In gemrany they want to legalize marihuana too, but only in moderation 😯Good hehe ☺️😘Because the country's economic development is needed, so marijuana is allowed to flow into the market, because there are a lot of online frauds and so onOhh interesting...you know much about it 😯😯Yesyesyes而且什么色情好多，稍微不注意就会被骗控制到不认识的地方，让人去欺骗别人要钱，如果业绩不好就被虐待，骗到泰国就再也不能和外界交流，所以中国对这些事情很重视，非必要不要去泰国旅游😂🤣Ohhh you mean there are girl who have sex with you for money and people you steal money from you? 😱

I really don't want to go to Thailand 😭😱就是骗人去说来泰国工作，会挣好多好多钱，被抓到的女生会强迫进行性交易，被抓到的男生去进行网络诈骗，业绩不好就会被打我说的是真的😂🤣我平时喜欢看新闻What??? So girls are forced into sex work??? 😱😰YesI trust you 😅

How do you mean that?😅中国对禁毒打击特别严厉，在我的日常生活中都遇不到我只是问问，没什么Oh yes yes, it's better毒品是摧毁家庭的，很可怕你一定要注意🥰为了家庭和自己的健康I remember on one birthday where we were in a forest. And they had a joint and asked me if I want to smoke and I: No no no!Yes I know how bad drugs are, I never wanted to touch them and I never will want to touch them 🥰good🥰How is it with alcohol in china?In germany it's very common the you drink alcoholI don't drink alcohol...I don't understand why you should harm yourself 😰I haven't drunk alcohol. I know that it's BaiGan in China. It's very spicy. My father and grandpa like to drink it.？我喝酒？我什么时候喝酒了？Oh no no, I don't mean you with "you". That you is meant in general...like "someone"upps 🤣OhohI drunk 2 times in my past. On a birthday and on my graduation 😅Drinking a small amount of alcohol is good for the body and promotes blood circulation, but drinking for a long time is harmful to the bodyIt was for 5 years and on the birthday I was completly sane and only was a bit funny.

On my graduation the party was the whole night. And I slowly drunk too much.
Wodka tastes like water...like nothing...really crazy. At some point in the next morning I drunk so much that I don't know what happend there 😅😂
But my friends took good care of me ☺️
And I remember the way back home. We walked and I head hurts. And I had to throw up the whole day 😅😅
I tried to eat something...but 5 minutes later I throw up again...it was horrible 😅Yes that's true, but I better drink nothing that's the best 🤣☺️My poor boyIt was my fault, I got what I deserved 😄我好奇喝多酒是什么感觉没事的，让我想想🤔️一个谚语怎么说了Your perception changes dramatically. You can't think normally and all is blurred and than if you keep drinking there is a cut and you can't remember 😂吃一堑长一智！这个意思是受到一次挫折后，通过得到教训而增长一分才智。这是经历过失败取得教训的道理Really? I want to drink on my birthday next time😆😆😆😁😁😁Thank you ☺️😘

I learned a lot from it and I don't drink alcohol because of it...I'm afraid what I did at the end..how I said: I can't rember on the last time 😯I'm curious about that feeling！But it slowly increases. So it changes slowly. First it will be all normal🤣😂yesHave fun! I hope you will be fine! ☺️😲😲😲 I'm so curious!Haha 😘😘You sound like me talking about sex 🤣🤣🤣😂🤣😂I understand that you are curious how it feels to drink alcohol, you have to make your experiences 😇因为我没有体验过，所以我好奇😯好奇喝醉😵‍💫You still sound like me 🤣🤣🤣😂Yes yes yesHahaYes I know 😘

I don’t understand,有没有同义词？12 year old boy is younger than a 18 year old boyAs exampleA smaller ageI don’t understand 😂🤣A kid is youngwe both are youngour parents notyou understand?I understand然后呢？Did you celebrate your birthday when you was younger?

But that was in the past haha 😅Yes, because when you grow up, you will feel ordinary if you know too much🥰😘我可以想象到Yes 😅☺️Growth will pay a lot of costs, such as childlike innocence, unlike before.🥰😘🥰😘That's true 😭👉🏻👈🏻What have the hormones done to me?😭What mean?荷尔蒙对你？你是男的当然有荷尔蒙了😂🤣No no 🤣
I said that Hormones changed me a lot and it was a rhetorical question: What did the hormones with me?You understand? 😅How do hormones affect you?Yes, I understand让你变得更帅更有魅力Like sexual desire 👉🏻👈🏻
As example🤣我知道你渴望但你先别渴望Say that to my hormones 🤣男的有荷尔蒙，女的有什么？？🤣😂Both have hormones 😊They are the communication for the brain我的荷尔蒙在哪里🧐？？Why am I not eager for sexual desire?You can't see them. They are inside you. In your blood or something like that...I'm not a biologist 😅Ohoh,但是你比我懂的多Good question...I don't know...maybe you have first have to make something sexual and than your hormons starts...or I really don't know 😅

I can't even understand how it has to be for you 😅What meanUmm...how to say it...

I can't imagine how strange it have to be for you to hear about such sexual things. Because you never heared about them and yes..这是真的… 因为可能受文化的影响，大多数人觉得太隐私，是羞耻的，我对性知识来说也不是知道很多…周围人很少提到所以你和我说的这么清楚，我打开了新世界Hehe wow yes that sounds big ☺️😘

It feels so interesting to discouver things with you 🥰昨天你和我说的自慰，我真的第一次听说😲😲，过几天我试一试🤔️🙀Ohhh really?

Keep it clean that's good. But with clean hands all should be fine ☺️But why do masturbate?🤔️For me it feels soooo good 😅
There is nothing I know what feels better 😅🙀But maybe it is a different thing for men? 😅完了，我更好奇了😯What? 😯Maybe你说完我更好奇了As far as I know there are different ways to masturbate as a womanHaha ☺️😘那我是不知道🤷……我还是不去触碰了❌🤣😘I heared that you can move your hand in a circle at the upper side of your vagina. Not bottom, not middle, upper side.
There is the clitoris. And rubbing it should feels good.

And you can fingering yourself. That means you move your finger in your vagina and touching and move the inside. And if you make it right, you should reach the g-point, which is a point which should feel also very good.

But I don't know 🤣 You can just chill 😘I watched a video a few years ago, because I was curious..🤣😅🙀我连阴道在哪我都不知道🤷‍♀️我无法掌握它的位置你了解的太清楚的，你副业不会是医生吧I don't know either 🤣😘Hahaha 🤣🤣🤣你比生物老师讲的都清楚你的学习能力让我佩服I'm just curious and and..and I would like to masturbate a woman 🤣 I'm so curious 😅😂Thank you 🤣😅😘😅😂你控制住你自己What you mean?我的意思是，你的荷尔蒙太强烈啦Yesss 😭😭😭 I'm weak 🤣I love to discover with you 😇☺️

That's a little bit embarassing I know 🤣What?????！！！？I don't know. I saw it in a video. It maybe feels good for you 🤣让人难以理解和接受呕～Oh oh why? Don't worry 🥺I would never do something you don't like 😰因为我第一次听说舔…Oh oh yes.

I decided to don't watch porn anymore...I don't like it...I don't want it 👉🏻👈🏻
For me it seems to be wrong to watch it 😰You are too curious 😂😘Why do you suddenly think so?I don't know...yesterday I don't liked how I wrote...I'm too perverse...and I don't want that 😰
That I said such thing to your innocent picture was too heartbreaking 😭

So I want to improve myself...Haha,Tobia.或许你可以转移注意力，你需要保持生活规律或者运动来放松自己。我不是男生我也不知道你对性欲来说是什么感觉，所以我站在你的角度去想问题我是理解的。
没关系，因为我喜欢你，你意识到了就应该去改正。Yes I have to lead my attention to something different...but that's difficult.

I think leaving porn is a good step and kinda healthy.
And trying to masturbate less is also a good step...but it will be really hard 😂🤣

I have to find out what helps if I feel the desire...I'm not sure what I can do if I want to do it to get rid of it 😅
Maybe I will ask google ☺️

Thank you 🥰I just read that it could help if I would make a routine (maybe that what you mean)...like a fixed date. Like maybe only every saturday or something like that.Ummmm,我已经帮你搜索过了，百度是这样说的
1、到正规医院去检查，什么什么肿瘤我不知道它写的是什么
2、避免完全沉浸在性生活的愉悦中，避免观看色情视频，多读一些对身心健康的书籍
3、保持生活规律和适当运动，加强身体锻炼，避免熬夜和手淫，不要穿紧身的内裤，克制自己的情欲，减少对性器官的刺激Oh oh😲You should delete the porn you watch, some similar websites, and delete the browsing history, which will be difficult for you🤣😂Oh wow...you really did a research for me 🥰😘

Thank you so much, I will try to apply these ☺️Yes that's true, I will delete all after my breakfast 😘Thank you shuyan for your help 🥰你只能自己对自己进行控制，全依靠你自己Yes 😇 I'm curious how it will work 🤣

I will tell you 😂😜What?我觉得你应该是误会我说的了，我说的是你要控制你自己，我帮不了你，你只能自己帮助你自己，我相信你可以做到😌🤪No no, you can help me, you just helped me ☺️😘

You are very good in helping me ☺️I mean that I'm curious how good I can resist and how it will feels and that I will keep you up to date 😇OkayNice,看起来很好吃😋你学会改变是你自己很厉害Thank you 😇It was tasty 😋😋吃好吧🥰我5点还要去排练，可是我真的不舒服我感觉最近很累，很累，很累Ohhh no 😰😰 Do you get sick? 😰I'm not sure…但是我感觉我快了还可能是天气原因主要是我精神压力的缘故Yes...my poor girl😰. Maybe you sleep an hour or maybe make a power nap and decide after it if you go or not.I must go to the rehearsal. I never sleep during the day🤣😂It could also be your mental stress, yes. You are always soo busy 😰

I hope it's the weather or/and your stress not an illnessYes I know, you said me that before 😅我的压力太大了，我都希望我生病能够放松休息😂🤣……但是我不能这么想…比我坚强的人太多了我凭什么不坚持😭😭有的时候我想哭No darling. You can think so. It's all right 😘
It's ok to feel overstressed. Accept it.
Try your best, but don't overdo it.

Yes there are stronger people, you don't have to be the strongest girl in the world 🥰
You are special and unique how you are.

You are awesome 🥰😘Thank you. I feel much happier. I will still persevere.哈哈😆Good ☺️
Yes try your best but know that you don't have to suceed everytime. I will catch you if you fall ☺️ and help you going your path 😇I'm actually very contradictory. I don't want to negative energy. Don't complain that it's wrong. Everyone in the position works very hard. I think I need to adjust myself🥰😘Thank you Tobia😭😭🥺🥺你真的很强大，我每次坚持不下去的时候只要想到你，我就会坚持Ohhh ☺️🤭😘
Of course I'm there for you 😇

And you are a very strong person 💪🏻☺️
You get that 😊I will soon go to in the city and let cut my hair✌️🏻Wow!我很期待你的新发型Hehe, I will show you it then ☺️😘😘好，我等你哈哈哈😆My father may have forgotten to have my daughter. He was immersed in his own world and began to ignore me. He was like a child😂🤣😂🤣🤪Ohhh 😯Yesterday I asked my father if he liked my gift? He said that he liked it very much. I said Dad, take a picture for me, and then he didn't know where to go. He didn't look at his mobile phone very often. Then I went to ask my mother. My mother said that my father put away the teacup and was reluctant to use it. My father was so funny😂🤣😂🤣Oh but why. It looks so nice. Maybe he want use it because he will keep it as memory?I'm going to bomb his mobile phone tonight. I asked him where he had gone, and he didn't reply to the message🤭🤭🤭Haha 😂🤣
You are awesome 😘我太了解他了，因为他喜欢我给他的礼物，他觉得很珍贵I go now to the city...but it's weird I get headache again 😰😅So cute ☺️？？你是不是太热了或者今天不出门难道你是长时间看电子产品导致你头疼？My temperature is pretty normal I think and maybe it come the electronic products...I'm not sureIt's so cute how you worry ☺️😨😰那你休息吧，你需要看绿色植物缓解疲劳。如果很严重你需要去医院检查，我希望你没事See you later, I'm going to rehearsal now.
别看手机了，你太累了So cute ☺️

I will try to go to the city...we will see what happens 😅Yesss ☺️
See you later 😘DavorDanachicecream against the heat 🤣Ohh I just saw that the girl I told you, who I sent nudes to, write me a letter on slowly...what does she want?...I'm afraid 🤣？？what mean芒果味的吗。？Maracuja ☺️太太太太太太太帅了！！，！，😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍🥰😘😘😘🥰🥰😘😘🥰🥰😘😘🥰🥰😘🥰😍🥰🥰发型很好看What is Maracuja我今天排练的时间很短，我生病了，同学也生病了，所以老师就让我们提前结束了，我的嗓子肿了😅😅我吃过它，我管它叫百香果Oh no...than you have to rest ❤️很酸，很甜，加蜂蜜更好喝！😋😋😋Yess, I love it 🥰Yes, I can't sing in the next few days.😭🥺What meanHaha Do you like my hairdresser from before more? 🤣😘Oh no...but your graduate singing is hopefully safe next week 😰I think they are all good-looking🥰😘是这周，不过就算不能痊愈也要坚持Yes yes let me explain.

I told you about that I sended nudes to a girl (she wanted it and left me after it, you remember?) and that girl send me a new letter on slowly now...I'm confused why she send me a letter now...I'm curious and afraid what she want...I will tell when the letter arrives...

You understand?Oh this week 😰那你还要回复她吗？And you will sing anyways?YesWhat do you mean? I don't have to answer her...or what?Nice!没事了，不理睬她☺️😘I'm only confused why she writes me now...🤣难道是是因为明天你的生日要祝福你的生日吗？Ohh you are smart...yes that could be. You are smart 😂🤣Thank you 😂🤣重要的日子我会记得Haha you are cute ☺️😘可是我不想让你去看那封信，因为我怕你想起那段不好的经历，但这是你的权利Don't worry, all will be fine ☺️😘

I have you, so I can endure everything 😇🥰🥰伤害过你，还要回头来找你，呜呜呜🥹Speak to my hand, I'm now with Shuyan 🥰😘🤣你可以把她拉黑吗……I don't know if that is possible on slowly...I'm not so the person who blocks other person 😅我现在就把我的想法说出来But don't worry, she will only say happy birthdayYes you can对于不礼貌的人要学会拒绝，你们俩已经不联系了，所以我觉得那封信就没有必要看，因为她伤害过你。如果我是你，我已经知道她给我生日祝福了，所以我根本不会去看那封信，还会拉黑。我尊重你，这都是你的选择，我只是把我的想法说出来Yes...you maybe right...but I'm too polite...I can't do that and she was often friendly. She hurts me but she was friendly...so I can't be unpolite to her 😰
Maybe I should...but I can't 😰

I will tell her from you and that she please don't write me again...but I only can say it friendly 😰你根本不用回复她啊，Tobia,你都不需要去读那封信。你能明白我的意思吗？如果断联系就要彻底，一干二净！我把我想说的说出来了，我尊重你你总是那么善良…Yes that's true. I will make a clean cut with her, but I will make it friendly.

Like imagine we would seperate us in future and you hurt me...I wouldn't be unpolite to you, because you are a nice person (the most special person), so I would respect you as a beautiful human beeing and I would give you the respect you deserve.

And the girl is not as special as you, but she is a kind human (I think) and she deserves respect too.I never would block you 🥺👉🏻👈🏻如果善良为什么会要求你做那种事情…好吧，没关系已经过去了我相信你能处理好事情的她不重要我不关心，我只关心你不要让她影响我们的美丽心情Yess and I care only about you 🥰You are my sun ☺️☀️让你做那种事情…😅我难以理解她的善良You are also like that! 😂😘？what你没听懂我的意思吗我的意思是她让你做过分的事情，你觉得她善良，但是我难以理解这种善良Ohhhh sorry I missunderstood对不起，我只是从你的口中了解她，所以我会把她想象成了坏人好吧，我们不说这个话题了，我相信你可以处理好一切Yes of course you only know what I told you. She is a kind person. I don't know why she did that...that move was not kind...no...really not...but else she is a kind person, else I wouldn't done such a crazy thing.

(若把你)HahahahThank you for likingI just returned to the dormitory. I accompanied my roommate to meet her ex-boyfriend. She broke up an hour ago, which was what I told you before. Then his boyfriend came to see him from Beijing. I thought they would get back together, but they broke up你知道歌词的意思吗？Oh really 😰YesI don't know, what is it about? ☺️歌词写的很美，我看一下给你说Yes, thank you 🥰This is a song of secret love. The fallen leaves have no roots, and the single thread is not made (poetry). The image of high mountains and flowing water shows that two people are confidants落叶无归根，单丝不成线是个诗词英语翻译的不对Ohh wow...beautiful 🥰

But it's not secret love like in the case of your roommate or? 😅It expresses women's longing. The core of this song is that women want to be with men, and men also like women.这首歌和我室友毫无关系😂🤣这是两件事，我只是和你说我刚才做什么去了Oh 🥰🥰🥰This song is beautifulWhat you did?什么我做了什么，我刚才陪她去找她前男友了，她自己不想去，所以让我陪她了你明白了？Oh yes yes I understand 😇GoodNow she has only 1 boyfriend?I don't know.

I hope you can sleep very well 🥰I will try ☺️
But I can't fall in sleep well the last days...I think too much these days 🥺👉🏻👈🏻
Most likely about you ❤️Oh thank you Shuyan...that's what I need right now❤️Thank you, let me tell you how it was and what we did 😊

First it was a bit weird. I waitet on the trainstation and than I saw her and it was the first time we met.
You already knows that I was nervous and she also was nervous.
So we went to the ice cream parlor and bought us ice cream. I had vanilla flavor and it was pretty good 😇
We talked a bit and the barrier between us disappeared more and more.
We were in the park, talked about her boyfriend and also about you 😘
Than it started to rain, so we went to my house and fed my dog and cat and continued to talk.
And yes that was. At the end the barrier was gone :)

And for me it was an very important meeting...because I wanted to see how it is to meet a friend who I only know from writting...and I wanted to know because of you 😊☺️
And to be honest, you only have to be relaxed and yourself and all is fine 🥰

I wish we would meet soon 🥰😘Now I was out with my dog and laying on the couch...I have ti eat something...but I don't know what...I currently only can think on you 🥰
But I'm hungry 😋 Should I eat the same thing as the last 2 days 😂🤣🤣🤣I slowly start to can't see that food anymore 😂And I really have to stop thinking now 😰
I search some food and will watch something on youtube or netflix or something like that ☺️I made me another food, it's ready pasta with tomato sauce ☺️ Yes that I also eat the lasr days, but it tastes very very different 😋I'm pretty tired and I want to sleep ☺️I miss you 🥺And I miss you saying that I have to go sleep now ☺️😘😘Enjoy your morning ☀️🥰I will try to sleep now 😇What are you thinking about?Thank you. It seems that you get along well with your friends. I'm glad to hear that you have relieved your nervousness. I think we will meet one day😁😆You can eat whatever you want😆😂🤣晚安，累了就早点睡觉。你睡的一定好你失明了吗？Tobia, tell me what you are thinking. I don't want to break the rules of your life because of me. I want you to have a good rest🥰😘Tobia, what I want to tell you is that you can find your own things to do when I'm not in you, and work hard when you are busy. You always think about me. I'm afraid you're tired. This is mental exhaustion. It's unhealthy for you. Can you understand what I mean? What I think is that you can do whatever you should do. We can leave messages to each other during the break. I don't want you to lose sleep because of me.🥰😘🥰你真的太厉害了，我再次发现你真的很喜欢番茄Good night 🥰😘我搬完行李了，我很倒霉，我的洗衣液撒了🤣😂
我的同学（男生）帮我搬行李，我很感谢他，我请他吃冰淇淋🤣😂It's exactly the same as the original dormitory, but the building has been changed.😂🤣I hope my boy can be motivated in everything he does, instead of consuming himself. Before I met you, I had a lot of negative emotions, and I was in a bad state at that time, but after meeting you, no matter how much pressure I am, I can move forward as long as I think of you. Thank you very much 🥰😘 I am lucky to meet youGood morning 😴🥰☀️

Positive reflection: "The english test was not good. I have to learn more next time and have to analyse what my fault are"

Maybe like that 😅可是我的难点就是分析我的错哈哈哈哈哈😂，我在想这个问题Tobia, you are really a genius😍😍😍🥰🥰🥰😘😘🥰🥰😍Yes yes. That is always the difficult part. Just continue to trying it.

And the masturbation feels so good but I also can't describe it 😅
And the highlight of male masturbation is to cum (I already told you ^^) and that's just mindblowing 🤣🥰 
I often do it before sleeping in
😳👉🏻👈🏻, because I can sleep so well when I came 🤣😅🥰😴Oh the morning air is soooo good 🥰🥰Remember to rest 😘我回来了，我考完试后和我的同学吃饭去了蛋挞！It could be your age,lt’s normal🥰😘😂🤣Yeah,但我现在不困了You’re amazing,!🤗🤗👏👏👏👏👏👏Wow!我很崇拜你，😍😍😍🥰🥰😘🥰你是如此的优秀Don't feel guilty, haha😲好吧哈哈哈昨天我去网上搜索了一下，网上说女性的阴蒂是个小豆豆……这我无法掌握…所以我也不知道🤷我明白理论无法实践😂🤣😂Yes, yes, I've had a rest. I'm so happy that I don't have to be too nervous. The last subject is left to take the exam on Monday. After the exam, I can go home. I changed the high-speed rail ticket, that is, I'll be home on the afternoon of the 20th.I didn't eat in the morning. I was so hungry that I was too full at lunch. My stomach... I must eat on time next time.😅😂🤣😂🤣I lack sexual knowledge. If you hadn't told me, I don't know when I would know.😂🤣It must be your mood and beautiful air. You are really the god of egg tarts.😆But is it really good for your body to masturbate often? You often hurt your body like this. I hope you can control your frequency. If you mastitis too often, you will get prostatitis, sexual disfunction, urinary tract inflammation, mental depression, it's terrible!!! You must reduce the number of times😱😱😱😱I guess Tobia will arrive at the classroom at about 7:40…～Ohhh yesss! 😂今天换教室了哈哈哈😄你好可爱😍🥰😘Thank you 🥰🥰

Like with the masturbation, you try and are interested...It's really nice 🥰🥰I understand both, in german we sometimes also say it in that order 😂😘My curiosity is beating. It's not that I don't want to try or I can't do it at all, because I don't know where the clitoris isHaha, I don't understand. Is it so difficult to find 😯Oh oh.那德语的语序和英语的语序一样吗？是的，非常难找到But don't stress yourself, we will find out 😂☺️🥰😘English and german are often the same, yes :)Mhh I have to make more research to tell you more 😅I watched a popular science video saying that the clitoris will be wrapped and needs stimulation to appear, so I don't knowOh interesting 😯呜呜，我有时会读英语会被语序弄的晕头转向你比女人都懂的多，我很佩服你Alright, let's talk about another topic, I get a errection 😂🤣🤣WhatI'm not sure...but I'm curious 🥰Ummm...how I should tell you.
Errection means that blood flows in my penis with the effect the it become bigger and harder...and I'm currently in the train, so it's a bit embarrasing 😂🤣🤣🤣I have to sit like that, so that I can hide it 😂🤣🤣It's kinda funny how my penis looks without an errection in comparison to with errection 😂😂这…真的会很尴尬所以你什么时候会好？What you mean? Ready for what?😘Ready for sex? 🤭我的网络巨差无比Oh my god!我的网络，发不出去I'm sorry, I will wait 🥰😘I'm now in the bus ☺️不是，我的意思是你什么时候才能恢复正常的阴茎Like, there is no static time. When I came than it will get normal, or when I have normal/different thoughts.

Where we wrote about sex it got harder (but not complete hard) and than I walked to the bus and my penis got less hard and now it get harder again 😂🤣🤣Tobia，晚安💤我要睡觉了这个网速让我无语，突然就这样了Yes yes, good night 🥰😘😘真的很神奇Yes, I wouldn't believe it if I would not see it by my own😅It was so weird and I feel so bad right now.
In the bus was a weird guy who started to talk with a young girl and he asked if he get her number and she said no.
But he didn't stop asking. 
I wanted to help her but I wasn't sure if she needed help...so I waited and watched the situation. She answered very well and I think she did it very well...but it was weird and I feel guilty that I doesn't helped her...but if it was more out of control I would help her...of course 😰

But it's all fine...I just wish that I would have enough courage to help her...next time I will help...I promise. I learned from it 💪🏻晚安😘这个网络终于终于恢复了You are still awake 😱I will miss you 🥰😘😘谁懂啊，发一条信息花费了半个小时的时间ohhh 😰😰 but now I received your message 🥰😘😘You are so cute, that you want to say me good night 🥰🥰🥰我太困了，我明天早上回复你🥰晚安😴Yes, sleep darling 🥰❤️😘I'm so curious how you would react if you would see my penis 😂

Why I have such thoughts 😅😂
Weird 😂Haha and you would be very suprised if you would see me cumming 😂🤣

But I would like to see your reaction 😂😅Sooo, I hope you sleep well 🥰
Recover and get some energy 💪🏻🥰If you see this message it's already the 16th so you will go home really really soon ☺️Sooo I just watch a really really good video about female masturbation from a doctor and she said really much.

I will try to tell you the most important things.
Masturbation is a private act (you probalby know that 😂) and that you don't have ti shame abkut that, because all do that ☺️

And I understood it like you should explore it in your time. If it doesn't feel good, don't do it, try a different spot or another movement.
And there are many ways to masturbate. Some women like that some like another thing.
So explore, touch different spots of your vagina and just make some cycling and rubbing movements (very gentle).
Maybe try on the top of your vagina, but maybe on the side or on the bottom feels better.

And there is no specific age for it, so don't worry ☺️😘

Now I'm really curious 😂
I would love to try that out 😂
But I can't 🤣That topic makes me really horny 😂🥰
I have to masturbate now 😂🤣I did it ☺️
I'm sorry...my thoughts are normal again ☺️😘

I think I will eat something and then I will program 😇Coffee and Cake time, you know it 😂
But pretty late 🤭I had a wonderful day ☀️
I really enjoyed it 💫🥰I just relax now with my family 🥰🥰 I'm pretty tired 😴😇A classmate gifted these to me 🥰Dinner time☺️✌️🏻coffee time (esspresso)I remembered that I don't like coffee 😝😂🤣🤣Suddenly I don't feel good...maybe it's because of the coffee...I feel a bit dizzy and have a weird feeling in my stomach 😰
It doesn't feel good.

I will just lay in my bed now and will try to relax😰I really don't feel good...I feel sick...and that triggers my anxiety...but I have it under control right now, so don't worry 🥰😘You are in the dreamworld, where just happiness exist😇🥰I just listen to music and try to calm downThank you for sending, I like it. Interesting mix, this e-guitar as relaxed instrument...interesting. I really like the topic of the song...it's beautiful 🥰🥰🥰🥰Oh wow...I like this one even more 😍🥰😘😘
